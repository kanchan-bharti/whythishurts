Migraines are one of the top 20 most disabling illnesses in the world.\n\nAmong adolescents, migraines are more common in boys than in girls. Among adults, however, migraines occur more frequently in women than in men. They are also more likely to affect those who have family members that often experience migraines.\n\nThere are two basic types of migraine headaches: migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Auras are visual disturbances that consist of bright spots, flashing lights, or moving lines. In some cases, auras cause a temporary loss of vision. These visual disturbances occur about 30 minutes before the migraine begins and can last for 15 minutes.\n\nMigraine with aura tends to be less severe and disabling than migraine without aura. However, most people experience migraine without aura.\n\nHemiplegic migraines are another type of migraine. These migraines are accompanied by stroke-like symptoms, such as slurred speech and numbness or weakness on one side of the body.'

The prodrome phase may affect concentration, mood, and appetite. This phase may also cause frequent yawning.\n\nPeak headache is the period when migraine symptoms become the most severe. This phase may last for several minutes.\n\nPostdrome is the 24-hour period after the migraine. During this time, drowsiness can occur and mood can fluctuate between feelings of sadness and feelings of joy.'
